User data is stored in a path-based structure `/users/{userId}` for simple ownership rules. The user document includes `emailVerified` field to control access to certain features based on email verification status.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved by storing all necessary authorization data directly within the user document, avoiding the need for `get()` calls in security rules.\n\nQAPs are supported through structural segregation, ensuring that all documents within the `/users/{userId}` collection share the same security requirements. This prevents the need for complex filtering within rules."
